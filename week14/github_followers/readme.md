GitHub Followers

Description:
	Create a service that allows for a user to search for a GitHub user.

	On a successful search return, display the user's GitHub handle, follower count, and a list of the user's followers (just the avatar is fine).

	Create a "load more" button that, when clicked, fetches the next pageload of followers. This button should persist until there are no more pages of followers to fetch. 

Technical choices:
	Bootstrap is a framework I'm comfortable with, and allowed me to address most of my UI needs. As far as layout, I played around with other ways of listing more results per page, however seemed overwhelming.

	Animate.CSS was added for some emphasis on title and returned user search results. 

	Although I used jQuery for my requests I have used primarily native JavaScript to breakdown and organize all steps. 3 ajax calls were made, however I wanted to  

	Pagination was an option that I looked into and would potentially apply given more time in order to address the issue of users with many follower pages, however the assigned "load more" button keeps things simple, and easy. I added a Back to Search anchor to quickly get back to the top.

	Another valuable addition, would be the ability to sort through users.
